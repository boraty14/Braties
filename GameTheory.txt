notes from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ3kFydI_xQ&list=PL6EF60E1027E1A10B GameTheory class

L1 - Do not play for strictly dominated strategy.
L2 - Personally optimized results may suck compared to collective ones
L3 - You have to know what you want to get what you want - Payoffs matter.
L4 - Put yourself at others shoes and try to figure out what they will do.

- Common knowledge is not so common.
- Take care how many steps you put yourself in other's shoes.
- Mutual knowledge: everyone knows. Common knowledge: Eveyone knows and everyone knows that everyhone knows

- Median Voter Theorem: People tend to crowd into middle, voting, stations (same spot so does not lose competition) etc.
