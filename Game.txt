notes from https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en/videos for game insights

- Hit stop, show important moments in your game!
- Balance risk and reward (less risk/reward => more casual, wider audience)
- Game dev is also work, you don't have to particularly like it
- Take care of lag, responsiveness really effects gameplay feeling.
- Apply stress accordingly, (squeeze and release)
- For the art, first draw the light not the asset
- Not just games, but in presentations you also need to be fast, trim the fat, be direct.
- Animation references matter, even though even after them still animators needs to fill in the blanks.
- Rpgs (turn based) can vary if you make it more complex/more casual. Act according to your audience.
- To make game enjoyable both for beginners and advanced, make game playable with basic mechanics but also let advanced players to play in advanced optional mechanics.
- Push and pull : matter in each game. Push mean making player take action and pull means player can effect game without putting effort actively.
- In pull players feel urgency and pressure, in pull we reward and relax them.
- Make the vfx pop, make sure it is visible and understanble, mix it with contrast and crips effects.
- Think about how opposing elements can help you standout (both effects and design)
