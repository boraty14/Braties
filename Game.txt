notes from https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en/videos for game insights

- Hit stop, show important moments in your game!
- Balance risk and reward (less risk/reward => more casual, wider audience)
- Game dev is also work, you don't have to particularly like it
- Take care of lag, responsiveness really effects gameplay feeling.
- Apply stress accordingly, (squeeze and release)
- For the art, first draw the light not the asset
